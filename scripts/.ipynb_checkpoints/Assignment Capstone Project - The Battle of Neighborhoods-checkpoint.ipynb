    "\n",
    "Bogotá is the metropolitan center of Colombia, which is located at 2,600 meters above sea level. This city offers varied artistic expressions such as museum exhibits, dance, theater, music, and splendid cuisine ([1](#ref1)). There are also hundreds of places to go to eat and frequent food festivals ([2](#ref2)), and consequently, the catering industry could be a very competitive field in this city.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, the data available on restaurants and territorial distribution of Bogotá will be used to analyze and cluster different locations in which a restaurant could be potentially be established. It is also expected that the information analyzed can be useful to obtain a preliminary insight into the most appropriate types of restaurants and the users that are most likely to visit them. The results obtained in this study could be of interest to businessmen or investors that want to open a restaurant in Bogota, Colombia."
